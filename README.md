# News Article Bias Detection

The purpose of this project is to analyze and detect biases within news articles that can be found using an api from News API (https://newsapi.org/). Sentiments on Bias was detected using a machine learning pipeline developed from the huggingface community.

# Description
Media bias is ubiquitous (everywhere) and not easy todetect. It is always useful to compare several sources ofinformation and, in doing so, it becomes clear that media coverage is never completely objective. For this project, the goal is to identify key words within different articles by identifying bias by the use of language. For example, the use of labels such as “terrorist,” “revolutionary,” or “freedom fighter” can create completely different impressions of the same person or event.
